        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <h3>Visual and Structural Enhancements</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Reduced Visual Clutter:</strong> Replaced complex stacked bar charts with clearer visual types
                (e.g., line charts, simplified bars), especially in the “Incidents by Neighborhood” view.</li>
            <li><strong>Split Visuals Across Pages:</strong> Spaced out visualizations into multiple pages to reduce
                user overwhelm.</li>
            <li><strong>Streamlined Labels and Titles:</strong> Eliminated vague labels like “miscellaneous” or “other”
                and revised titles for clarity and consistency.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Filter Functionality Improvements</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Synchronized Filters:</strong> All filters now consistently update all relevant visuals.</li>
            <li><strong>Descriptive Tooltips:</strong> Dropdowns now include helpful explanations of their scope and
                functionality.</li>
            <li><strong>“Apply All” Button:</strong> Users can now reset or apply all filters in one click.</li>
            <li><strong>Removed Erroneous Options:</strong> Eliminated “null” crime types and invalid years like 2025
                from filters.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Clarity and Accessibility Enhancements</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Plain Language Descriptions:</strong> Simplified section descriptions for users with different
                levels of data literacy.</li>
            <li><strong>Expanded Tooltips and Data Definitions:</strong> Added hover explanations for crime types (e.g.,
                property vs. person crimes) and clarified data ranking versus count distinctions.</li>
            <li><strong>Dynamic Hover Data:</strong> Tooltip values now reflect filter selections and show accurate,
                updated info.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Data Accuracy and Interpretability</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Validated Chart Logic:</strong> Addressed arithmetic inconsistencies and ensured values align
                across visuals.</li>
            <li><strong>Automatic Sorting:</strong> Charts like “When Do Incidents Occur?” now default to descending
                order for clearer insight into crime frequency.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Demographic Information</h3>
        <p>Several participants suggested the inclusion of demographic, housing, mental health, or socioeconomic data.
            While these are valuable, they exceed the current project scope and we addressed this by clarifying that
            this data is intended to be supplementary.</p>
        <h3>Project Overview and Purpose</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Simplified Language:</strong> The original text was rewritten to be more direct and welcoming.
                It avoids technical jargon and clearly communicates who the dashboard is for: community developers,
                policymakers, and funders.</li>
            <li><strong>Clarified Intent:</strong> The purpose now emphasizes equity, safety, and revitalization,
                aligning with the project's mission and stakeholder values.</li>
            <li><strong>Expectation Management:</strong> We clarify that the dashboard does not include (e.g.,
                demographics, housing, income data) to help users understand its scope and encourage them to use it in
                conjunction with other tools.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Data Source and Timeframe</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Specific Data Citation:</strong> Clearly notes the dashboard uses SFPD incident reports from
                2018 to the present.</li>
            <li><strong>Definition Clarity:</strong> Mentions that the dashboard follows local classification systems,
                which adds legitimacy and helps orient users to how crimes are categorized.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>How Can It Be Used</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Rewritten for Accessibility:</strong> The bullet points were rewritten in plain language.</li>
            <li><strong>Specific User Tasks:</strong> They now list specific user tasks, such as identifying affected
                neighborhoods, analyzing trends by time, examining crime types and correlations.</li>
            <li><strong>Demographic Context Cue:</strong> While the dashboard doesn’t contain demographic data, the text
                now notes users should consider combining it with other datasets for broader decision-making, which was
                a recommendation from our Usability Report.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Key Findings Section</h3>
        This section was newly added and is a direct result of the usability feedback:
        <ul>
            <li>Boxed Visual Insights were created to help non-technical users grasp<ul>
                    <li>Temporal Patterns (crime peaks on weekends/evenings, useful for planning)</li>
                    <li>Geographic Hotspots (targeted interventions)</li>
                    <li>Trend Analysis (some crimes decreasing, others not—useful for policy)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>These findings translate data into action and provide executive-level summaries, which were requested by
                policy and nonprofit stakeholders in your study</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Visual and Structural Enhancements</h3>
        This section was newly added and is a direct result of the usability feedback:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Navigation Buttons:</strong> The “View Crime Trends & Maps” and “Learn About the Researchers”
                buttons were added to guide users intuitively to next steps.</li>

            <li><strong>Layout Spacing and Hierarchy:</strong> Layout Spacing and Hierarchy: Clear separation between
                sections and consistent headings make the homepage easier to scan.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>When Incidents Occur Improvements</h2>
        <h3>Data Accuracy and Interpretability</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Chart Validation and Synchronization:</strong> The “When Do Incidents Occur” section has been
                overhauled to ensure that the “Incident Classification by Year” and monthly incident line charts respond
                consistently to selected year filters. This resolves prior confusion where users expected
                synchronization across visual elements but encountered static or inconsistent charts instead.</li>
            <li><strong>Improved Tooltip and Hover Data:</strong> Users can now hover over bars and lines to view
                incident counts by category and month. These details dynamically reflect filter selections, which helps
                clarify discrepancies and improves real-time interpretability.</li>
            <li><strong>Automatic Sorting for Readability:</strong> The bar chart now automatically sorts crime types in
                descending order to help users quickly identify the most frequent incident types by year.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Temporal Patterns and Year Filter Functionality </h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Updated Descriptions in Plain Language:</strong> The section explaining the charts now uses
                layperson-friendly language to guide users. It clarifies the purpose of the dual chart
                layout—year-over-year incident totals above and month-by-month variation below—making the function of
                each visual more intuitive.</li>
            <li><strong>Clarified Year Filter Behavior:</strong> We addressed confusion around the "Year" dropdown by
                ensuring that the selected years apply clearly and consistently across all relevant charts. A note now
                prompts users to click "Apply" after selecting filters to ensure proper rendering.</li>
            <li><strong>Resolved Year Option Errors:</strong> Erroneous or misleading year entries (e.g., 2025 with
                incomplete data) were removed. Charts now only display valid years to prevent misinterpretation of
                trends.</li>
            <li><strong>Enhanced Layout Readability:</strong> Text crowding within the bar chart labels was addressed by
                adjusting label spacing, improving legibility, and reducing clutter, especially for crime classification
                categories like "Miscellaneous" or "Other".</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These changes respond directly to user feedback that emphasized difficulty interpreting time trends and
            inconsistencies in filter behavior. The “When Do Incidents Occur” section now offers more reliable
            interaction and better supports community decision-making and temporal analysis.</p>
        <h2>Incidents Occurrence Heatmap Improvements</h2>
        <p>As part of our broader effort to improve temporal clarity and usability, we implemented the following
            changes:</p>
        <h3>Clarified Purpose and Interpretation</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Descriptive Introduction Added:</strong> Added a descriptive introduction to help users
                understand the function of the heatmap.</li>
            <li><strong>Clarified Color Meaning:</strong> Clearly explained that darker red cells indicate higher crime
                counts, enabling users to visually identify peak periods of crime by type and month.</li>
            <li><strong>Contextual Use Explanation:</strong> Updated text to explain how this tool can support community
                planning and prevention initiatives.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Filter Functionality and Control Labeling</h3>
        <p>We improved data transparency by addressing user confusion about the information being displayed and
            controlled. We improved dropdown labeling for filters such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><i>View Parameter</i> (crime category vs. type)</li>
            <li><i>Time Granularity</i> (month/year)</li>
            <li><i>Incident Year Filter</i> (selection for valid years).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Tooltip Consistency and Data Values</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Tooltips now show actual crime counts when hovering over any cell.</li>
            <li>All values dynamically reflect filter selections, giving users accurate, contextual feedback in real
                time.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Accessibility and Visual Clarity</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>We improved color gradients for readability by all users, including those with visual impairments.</li>
            <li>Reduced reliance on hovering alone by displaying crime counts directly in each cell based on a usability
                request from multiple participants.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Removal of Redundant or Unclear Classifications</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Cleaned up labels such as “Miscellaneous” and ensured crime categories align with federal or local
                classification standards where possible.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Geographic Crime Distribution Improvements</h2>
        <p>This panel, which combines a heatmap of incident density by neighborhood with a bar chart of the top 15
            locations, was refined in several key ways to improve interpretability, filter clarity, and comparative
            insights.</p>
        <h3>Improved Labeling and User Guidance</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The section introduction was rewritten in plain language to help users quickly understand the
                dual-purpose of the visual: spatial intensity (via heatmap) and frequency ranking (via bar chart).</li>
            <li>Additional guidance was included for applying filters and understanding performance expectations when
                large datasets (e.g., “All” years) are selected.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Synchronized Filter Controls</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Dropdown filters for year, month, and weekday are now clearly labeled and update both the heatmap and
                bar chart simultaneously, aligning with improvements to other dashboard components.</li>
            <li>A reminder to click “Apply” was added to ensure users finalize their filter selections, which was a
                frequent usability issue noted in feedback.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Data Clarity and Visual Contrast</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Color scales for the geographic heatmap were adjusted for better contrast and to be more intuitive:
                darker areas now clearly indicate higher crime rates.</li>
            <li>The color ramp includes a visible legend, helping users interpret quantitative values (ranging from 20
                to 11,642) without guesswork.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Rankings Visualization</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The "Top 15 Incident Locations" bar chart now includes:
                <ul>
                    <li>Clearly labeled neighborhood names</li>
                    <li>Aligned numerical values for quick comparison</li>
                    <li>More even spacing and adjusted font for improved readability</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Data Accuracy and Performance</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Neighborhood boundary data was reviewed for alignment with city records to ensure that heatmap values
                are geographically accurate.</li>
            <li>Performance improvements were made for faster rendering when filters span multiple years or city-wide
                views.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Crime Type Ranking Improvements</h2>
        <h3>Clarified Narrative and Use Instructions</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The section header and intro text were rewritten to clearly explain what the chart does not show exact
                counts, rather ranking order of crime types over time.
            </li>
            <li>A tip was added to guide users that they should hover over the lines to view exact incident counts by
                year and crime type.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Differentiated Design for Visual Clarity</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Color-coded lines were introduced and refined to visually separate each crime category across years.
            </li>
            <li>Additional endpoint labels now display the most recent incident totals (e.g., "Larceny Theft: 23,028
                incidents"). This makes it easier to interpret current trends without hovering.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Interpretation Aids for Non-Technical Users</h3>
        <li>Supporting text now includes examples (e.g., larceny consistently ranking high) to guide user interpretation
            of temporal rank shifts.
        </li>
        <li>References were added to direct users to the “Incident Classification by Year” chart if they want total
            counts rather than ranks.
        </li>
        <h3>Performance and Interactivity</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The line chart now dynamically adjusts when filters are applied, syncing with broader dashboard
                parameters such as year selection.</li>
            <li>Performance optimizations were made to reduce lag when displaying several years of data simultaneously.
            </li>

        </ul>
        <h3>Cleaned and Verified Crime Category Labels</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Categories such as "Other Miscellaneous" and "Non-Criminal" were clarified, and hover tooltips now
                include both the rank and number of incidents to improve transparency.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Crime Type TreeMap Improvements</h2>
        <p>The TreeMap panel was significantly enhanced to make it easier for users to explore the spatial distribution
            of crime types across San Francisco neighborhoods. This visualization now offers clearer insights into which
            types of crimes are most common in specific areas, with improvements aimed at better readability, filtering,
            and interpretability.</p>
        <h3>Revised Section Description and Instructions</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Introductory text was rewritten in plain language to explain how to interpret box size (frequency) and
                color (neighborhood).
            </li>
            <li>New guidance now explains how to use the filters for neighborhoods and crime types, and prompts users to
                click "Apply" to activate selections.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Enhanced Filter Functionality</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Dropdown filters for Neighborhood and Incident Category are now more responsive and clearly labeled.
            </li>
            <li>Tooltip updates allow users to see incident counts, neighborhood names, and percentages when hovering
                over boxes.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Improved Labeling and Visual Legibility</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Long or overlapping labels were adjusted to prevent truncation.
            </li>
            <li>To improve usability for screen readers, important numeric values (e.g., “20,060 incidents” and
                “43.30%”) are now embedded directly in each box, which reduces reliance on hover-only access and
                improves usability for screen readers.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Color Clarity and Group Differentiation</h3>
        <p>Neighborhoods are now color-coded with a consistent palette, which makes iit easier to visually group related
            boxes (e.g., all South of Market incidents appear in shades of dark gray). This helps users quickly compare
            crime type dominance across areas like the Tenderloin, Mission, and Downtown/Union Square.</p>
        <h3>Interpretation Support</h3>
        <p>Text explicitly clarifies that the chart shows distribution within neighborhoods, not time trends, helping
            manage expectations about what insights this visualization provides.</p>
